# BICE-rdlc
  This Mod aims to add focus trees to all Eastern European countries and aims to function as a BlackIce Submod until it reaches a level of quality that would be enough     for it to be hopefuly and eventualy included in the official BlackIce
  You will need all 3 parts of the BlackIce mod in order to play: (Non-BICE version might become available at a later point, non-BICE compatibility not guaranteed)
