# Romanian Eastern Europe Rework Decisions
###########################

#decision for arresting Codreanu; needs a lot of PP and will be harder if he isn't already on trial/accused

#decision for killing Codreanu; costs a lot of PP

#decision for appointing Antonescu as prime minister (as Carol II)

#decision for giving full power to Antonescu (as Carol II)

#decision for making Carol II abdicate in favor of his son (as Antonescu)

#decision for ending the legionnaire revolt; needs/costs some PP and requires troops in bucharest

#decision for turning arms against germany, only if the current power does it, whatever that power may be i guess; would probably need to include a surrender; maybe it can be done in a generic way so it works in ahistorical scenarios too?
