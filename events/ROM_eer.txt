#26 june 1940 USSR sends ultimatum asking for evacuation of bessarabia and bukovina; king asks germany but germany suggests that romania accepts (link this to M-R Pact?) after a new ultimative note on 27, the crown council votes to accept; romania takes some of the refugees; occupied/invaded on 28 june(-3 july???)
#carol makes 180 degree turn in politics; renounces the anglo-french guarantees and declares orientation towars axis; in order to improve relations with germany he reconciles with the legionnaires and Sima is introduced in the govt. on 28 june

#romania accepts ceding southern dobruja on 21 august 1940; signs the treaty on 7 sept; population transfer

#29 august second vienna award in belvedere palace in vienna; ceded after 30 august
