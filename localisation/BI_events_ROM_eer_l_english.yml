 rom_eer_1936.20.desc:0 "At the Student Congress that took place in Târgu Mureş from 2 to 5 April 1936, the people who, allegedly, threatened the captain's life (Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's life) were denounced, and death teams were formed to avenge him, if he was physically removed. This commitment tensions the internal situation even more."
 rom_eer_1936.30.desc:0 "In September 1934, after being accused of trying to poison Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, Stelescu was investigated by an Iron Guard party jury; expelled, he is thought to have broken away from the Legion (AKA the Iron Guard/Garda de Fier) before the actual verdict. \n\nAs a consequence, in 1935, he created his own political movement, originally called the White Eagles, but later known as the Crusade of Romanianism, and began publishing a weekly magazine of the same name, in which he fiercely attacked Codreanu and the Legion. \n\nIn 1936, Stelescu was admitted to a Bucharest hospital, for an appendectomy. While recovering, he was found by the Decemviri (Latin for "Ten Men"), a Legionnaire death team probably created as early as 1935 in Târgu Mureş. The assassins riddled his body with some 200 bullets, after which they left the hospital unmolested and surrendered voluntarily to the police. \n\nWhile officially both Codreanu and the Decemviri claimed that action had taken place without Codreanu's knowledge or consent, the probability remains unlikely; furthermore, Codreanu personally awarded each one of them the White Cross while they were kept in prison."
 rom_eer_1936.40.desc:0 "A very talented diplomat, Titulescu is the artisan of Romania's inter-war alliances and has been the president of two League of Nations meetings.\n\nIn June 1936, Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolae Titulescu famously reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: "To the door with the savages!" ("A la porte les sauvages!").\n\nAdditionally, Titulescu was trying to improve relations with the Soviet Union, among other eastern European countries, which was seen as foolish by many. In reaction to this, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu wrote a memorandum where he promises that he and his party will personally shoot those who would be responsible for Romania joining a war on the same side as the Soviet Union, a country which he considered to be a "destroyer of Christian civilization". \n\nLater in 1936, under pro-Nazi parties pressure and worsening diplomatic ties in Europe, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country."
 rom_eer_1937.10.desc:0 "In 1936, as a reaction to Titulescu morally supporting the communist side in the Spanish Civil War, the Iron Guard (Garda de Fier) sent seven of its men to fight on the nationalist side. However, Ion Moţa and Vasile Marin, two of those seven men, have been killed by an artillery shell in the Spanish town of Majadahonda (near Madrid).\n\nThe Iron Guard will repatriate them back to Romania and tour their coffins around the country for the following month before burying them in an elaborate well-attended ceremony, which will serve them very well in terms of propaganda."
 rom_eer_1937.20.desc:0 "Near the end of february 1937, King Carol II, planning to make Romania into an authoritarian state under himself, arranged a meeting with the "captain" (leader) of Romania's biggest fascist party (the Iron Guard), that being Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. During this meeting, he asked Codreanu if he would accept to become prime minister under the condition that he, the King, would instead become the "captain" or leader of the Iron Guard.\n\nCodreanu refused, stating that the legionnaires (the members of the Iron Guard) have sworn loyalty to him, and that this cannot be the object of political games.\n\nThe King was disappointed and realized that, unlike with other politicians, he cannot reach a compromise with Codreanu.\n\nThis made it clear both for Codreanu and for the King that they are now each other's enemy and that no compromise can be reached."
