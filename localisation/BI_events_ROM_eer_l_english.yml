 rom_eer_1936.20.desc:0 "At the Student Congress that took place in Târgu Mureş from 2 to 5 April 1936, the people who, allegedly, threatened the captain's life (Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's life) were denounced, and death teams were formed to avenge him, if he was physically removed. This commitment tensions the internal situation even more."
 rom_eer_1936.30.desc:0 "In September 1934, for mysterious reasons, Stelescu was investigated by an Iron Guard party jury; expelled, he is thought to have broken away from the Legion (AKA the Iron Guard/Garda de Fier) before the actual verdict. \n\nAs a consequence, in 1935, he created his own political movement, originally called the White Eagles, but later known as the Crusade of Romanianism, and began publishing a weekly magazine of the same name, in which he fiercely attacked Codreanu and the Legion. \n\nIn 1936, Stelescu was admitted to a Bucharest hospital, for an appendectomy. While recovering, he was found by the Decemviri (Latin for "Ten Men"), a Legionnaire death team probably created as early as 1935 in Târgu Mureșş. The assassins riddled his body with some 200 bullets, after which they left the hospital unmolested and surrendered voluntarily to the police. \n\nWhile officially both Codreanu and the Decemviri claimed that action had taken place without Codreanu's knowledge or consent, the probability remains unlikely; furthermore, Codreanu personally awarded each one of them the White Cross while they were kept in prison."
