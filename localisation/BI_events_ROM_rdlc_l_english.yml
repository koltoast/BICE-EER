 romania.17.d:0 "As part of a rearmament program of the late 1930s, Romania sought to obtain a license for the local manufacture of two hundred French Renault R35 infantry tanks.  By early 1938, negotiations for establishing a factory for the production of R35 tanks had reached an advanced stage.  By this time France's own demands for rearmament prohibited further development.\n\nIn August and September 1939, as a stopgap measure, forty-one R 35s were supplied to the Royal Romanian Army. These tanks served as the principal tank of the newly-formed 2nd Armoured Regiment. At the end of September 1939, an additional thirty-four brand new R 35s passed into Romanian hands when the Polish 21st Light Tank Battalion."

Numerous voices raised in protest against the cowardly approach of Romanian authorities related to territorial cessions, while there was an army ready and willing to fight.  Lt. general Ion Antonescu (he had been promoted on September 16th 1940) realized he had to act quickly.  He promptly retired 80 superior officers, considered incompetent or men of the former regime, with another 84 soon following.\n\nHe also began a reorganization of the army according to German military doctrine, and adopted an increasingly harsher attitude towards the legionnaire propaganda in the army, forbidding the officers and NCOs to get involved in politics."

Antonescu accepted on 31 July. In fact the Romanian Third Army had already crossed the Dnester on 17 July.\n\nThe Siege of Odessa was part of the Eastern Front area of operations and was primarily conducted by Romanian forces and elements of the German Army's 11th Army. Due to the heavy resistance of the Soviet 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which consisted of the Coastal Group of the 9th Army and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa."

 romania.23.t:0 "I.A.R. 80 Interceptor development"
 romania.23.d:0 "The IAR-80 was a Romanian World War II low-wing, monoplane, all-metal construction fighter aircraft. In 1930 the Romanian government issued specifications for a new fighter.  Although the government did not expect bids from its own aircraft industry, IAR company produced several prototype fighters in response to the tender. \n\nNone of the other Romanian companies entered a bid, and as the industry was rife with corruption, the government nationalized IAR while the other two companies were left to their own devices. Work began on the IAR80 prototype in late 1937, originally with an open cockpit and the 870 hp (649 kW) IAR K14-III C32 engine, which was a licensed Gnome-Rhône 14K II Mistral Major."
 romania.23.a:0 "Build it!"
 romania.23.b:0 "There's no need of 'toys' like that."
 romania.24.t:0 "Flight of the first IAR80 prototype"
 romania.24.d:0 "The IAR80 prototype was completed slowly, and first took to the air in April of 1939. Test flights of the prototype were impressive.  The aircraft could reach 510 km/h at 4,000 m (317 mph at 13,000 ft), service ceiling of 11,000 m (36,000 ft) with the ability to climb to 5,000 m (16,400 ft) in 6 minutes which was respectable at the time, though not up to the contemporary Supermarine Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters.\n\nThe IAR.80 proved to be highly maneuverable and, generally, a delight to fly. The ARR was impressed and ordered 100 of the new fighters on 18 December 1939, while orders for additional German He 112s beyond the original 30 were cancelled."

 romania.25.d:0 "Having accomplished the wishes of unity and independence by the end of World War I, Romania and Poland were interested in building relationships of friendship and cooperation between them in order to defend national sovereignty. Polish-Romanian political relations were initiated on 3 March 1921 by a treaty of friendship and cooperation that both countries pledged To provide mutual help in case one of them would be attacked, without provocation, on their part on their common borders in the east."\n\nOnce one of the Contracting States would be attacked, in terms of constituting a casus foederis,in accordance with provisions established between the two states, the co-signing State shall have the obligation to enact immediate mobilization . "
 romania.25.a:0 "Polish are great people."
 romania.26.t:0 "Economic Agreement with Germany"
 romania.26.d:0 "After Titulescu's removal, an improvement in the relationship with Germany was necessary due to it's significant rise of power while French influence was constantly fading. The pro-German policy of Romania’s allies, Poland and Yugoslavia, was another reason for this new orientation. Romania’s economic relation with Germany was very much in Romania’s favour. It provided a market for its agricultural products, a source of advanced technology that allowed a modernization of industry, and an alternative armament supplier. The economic agreement of December 1937 that led to an enhancement of economic trade showed the important place that Germany had gained in the Romanian economy."
 romania.26.a:0 "Maybe this is a good thing."
 romania.26.b:0 "We don't need them."
 romania.27.t:0 "Germany takes over Austrian businesses"
 romania.27.d:0 "The Anschluss conferred on the Reich the economic domination and a strategic position in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Germany took over all the Austrian businesses in Romania.\n\nThe 1934 German economic strategy, the Schacht Plan, introducing a new currency-control regime and German bilateral economic relations with the countries producing raw materials based on compensation arrangements, would soon be replaced by a New Plan, stipulating the concept of multilateral trade agreements and allowing the exchange of goods with countries with complementary economies.\n\nThe advantage for Romania would be that the New Plan was to provide a market for exported products at higher prices than those prevailing on world markets.  And Romanian food products were to be exchanged for German industrial goods."
 romania.27.a:0 "They are getting more and more influential in our country.."
 romania.28.t:0 "Titulescu Removed"
 romania.28.d:0 "In June 1936, Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolae Titulescu famously reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: To the door with the savages!" ("A la porte les sauvages!").\n\nLater in 1936, under pro-Nazi parties pressure, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country. Settling first in Switzerland, he later moved to France. While in exile, Nicolae Titulescu continued through conferences and newspaper articles to propagate the idea of the preservation of peace, perceiving the danger of a war that was to come all too soon after. He returned to Romania in November 1937, partly through the efforts of Iuliu Maniu."
 romania.28.a:0 "That is terrible!"
 romania.29.t:0 "Octavian Goga forms a government"
 romania.29.d:0 "After the elections, King Carol II used the pretext that no party was able to get a majority of 40%, and nominated Octavian Goga, the president of the National-Christian Party, as Prime Minister, asking him to form a government, although his party received less than 10% of the votes.This was only the first step in the royal dictatorship.\n\nIn doing so, the king placed several hits to the PNT party and its leader, Iuliu Maniu: PNT was to be removed from its succession, although it did receive double the amount of PNC's votes, the head of the government was to be an old, determined political adversary of Maniu, and several key members of PNT were to be lured to the king's side, including the newly appointed Minister of Interior, Armand Calinescu."
 romania.29.a:0 "Romania is decaying.."
 romania.30.t:0 "Carol II's personal authority regime"
 romania.30.d:0 "The beginning of 1938 faced a rise of the Iron Guard, which was fiercely attacking the regime ruling the country in order to shift Romania's foreign policy towards the Berlin - Rome axis.\nMoreover, Prime-minister Goga wanted to win the elections in March 1938 and therefore negotiated a secret agreement with Corneliu Codreanu. Democratic forces were confused and confusing, which enabled Carol II to intervene decisively and achieve his political objective.\n\nBy the coup of February 10, 1938, Carol dismissed Goga of the Council of Ministers and triggered the creation of a government headed by Patriarch Miron Cristea.\nThe 1923 Constitution was suspended and a new fundamental law was hastly developed and promulgated on February 27, 1938. "
 romania.30.a:0 "That can't be good."
 romania.31.t:0 "Suppression of the Legionary"
 romania.31.d:0 "Availing itself of the uncertain internal political climate as well as of the favourable international support of Germany and Italy, the Iron Guard increased it's pressure upon Romanian authorities through large scale public manifestations.\n\nFurthermore, on November 24th, 1938 during an official visit to Berlin, King Carol II was bluntly approached by Hitler relating to the immediate release from prison of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, and to the Romanian alignment to Axis international policies.\n\nThe King perceived the Legionary Movement as a threat, then more than ever, and as a result, during the night of 29-30 November 1938, Codreanu and 13 others were killed while allegedly trying to escape from prison. A systematic campaign of the authorities for the dismantling of the Legion was initiated."
 romania.31.a:0 "Interesting."
 romania.32.t:0 "Storm clouds gather"
 romania.32.d:0 "With their new orientation in foreign policy towards Germany, Romanian politicians cherished the illusion that Romania could secure Berlin's support for defending the territorial integrity of the country.  Such hopes would soon be proven not only illusory, but also dangerous for the country's future. The German government's response, handed by Ambassador W. Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness - to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere."

 romania.33.t:0 "Armand Calinescu appointed Prime Minister"
 romania.33.d:0 "On March 6, 1939, Patriarch Miron Cristea, the Prime Minister in office, passed away, and Armand Calinescu was appointed the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. As an economist and politician, Calinescu was initially one of the central wing leaders of the National Peasant Party, before becoming, in December 1938, a founding member of the royal party, the FRN.\n\nAfter holding positions as Minister of Health, Education and Homeland Defence, he was requested by King Carol II to form a government on March 7th, 1939. Calinescu continued the traditional Romanian policy of close relations with France and the United Kingdom and was to be the one to allow the Polish government, army and refugees to seek shelter on Romanian soil, much against Germany's protests."
 romania.33.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 romania.34.t:0 "Warsaw falls, Romania isolated"
 romania.34.d:0 "The occupation of Poland brought about the dissolution of the Romanian alliance system and left the Romanians into a state of deeper isolation on the international stage.  Although on September 7 Romania declared its neutrality in the conflict, it did allow passage of war materials aimed to reinforce Polish positions, and on September 13, the Polish National Treasury, estimated at about 45 million dollars, also received clearance to transit Romanian soil on its way towards France.\n\nTogether with the Treasury, about 50,000 Poles have gone to Romania to save their lives and seek refuge from which to resume the fight for homeland defense. Furthermore, on September 17, the Polish Government sought refuge in Romania as well.."

France supported the alliance by signing treaties with each member country.\n\nIt was thus stated that in the event of an unprovoked attack employed by Hungary against a certain stipulator other parties should provide mutual assistance. In addition, the treaties defined the mutual assistance via a special military convention which was to be signed. Until such a convention came into force, interim measures were to be taken. The member states of the Little Entente also pledged themselves to cooperation in terms of foreign policy towards Hungary as well as intense inter-members economic exchange."
 romania.35.a:0 "Good."
 romania.36.t:0 "Little Entente breaks apart"
 romania.36.d:0 "In 1938 the Czechoslovakian crisis broke. As it was clear that Great Britain's and France's reaction was far too weak and no substantial military support would be given to Czechoslovakia, Romania was also reluctant to grant support to its ally, in order to avoid a potential war with Germany. As a member of the Little Entente, Romania and Yugoslavia were compelled to offer military support to Czechoslovakia in case of a Hungarian attack but not in case of a German one.\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 30th, 1938 made Romania once again conclude that it should not count on Western support and convinced it of the necessity of maintaining neutrality between the Great Powers. Also, the Munich Treaty enhanced the economic influence of Germany over the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe."

 romania.37.d:0 "After the failure of the 'Neutral Countries' initiative, advised by the its Western allies, Romania oriented its focus towards strengthening the Balkan Pact. Between 2 and 4 February 1940, Romania and the Balkan Entente partners gathered in Belgrade, in the eighth Special Session, in an effort to deepen and coordinate the relations between the member states.\n\nSensing the increased danger hanging over the country, the Romanian government asked the allied governments to state their willingness to provide military support, should it come to an aggression against its territory. The response was disappointing, as the Balkan allies advised Romania to sacrifice itself in the interest of peace."  Later during the same year, as the Pact failed to achieve its purpose, Romania eventually gave up its position as a member state."

On his return, Antonescu adopted an intransigent attitude towards the Legion: On 18 January 1941, he disbanded the Romanization Commissions" controlled by the Guard and replaced all the legionnaire prefects.  Furthermore, following the failed investigation of the assassination of a German officer by a British agent, he dismissed the Legionnaire Minister of Interior, Constantin Petrovicescu, who refused to depose his mandate.

Shares were initially split between Blériot-Spad and Lorraine-Dietrich companies, Astra Arad factory, which provided equipment and trained staff, and the Romanian state, which provided the land for factory building near an airfield and a significant amount of money.\n\nDuring a decade and a half, the Romanian state-owned factories bought the French shares so that on September 1, 1938 the company became fully owned by Romania. The most famous aircraft series produced by I.A.R. were IAR 80 and IAR 81 fighter aircraft, which won a well-deserved prestige in their class."

Therefore, the tanks were sent back and changed in accordance with Romanian requirements.\n\nAll 126 tanks (called R-2 in Romania) were received by 1939, but another order for 382 tanks sent in mid-1939 was refused by the Germans.

The prototype had mounted only two Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale 7.92 mm machine guns, a licensed modification of the Browning 30 cal. This armament suite was clearly not heavy enough for combat use, and the production model was supposed to mount six of these guns.\n\nThe German invasion of Belgium and the Low Countries in 1940 ended the supply of the FN guns, and there was no indigenous machine gun that was suitable for use in aircraft. It wasn't until November 1940 when Romania joined the Axis that the Germans eventually allowed the delivery of the guns to resume. As a result the first production IAR.80 didn't roll off the line until January 1941, although the first batch of 20 had been quickly delivered by the middle of February."

This would have meant that Romania would have been obliged to support Czechoslovakia in case of a German attack. A treaty with France would have consolidated the pact. Romania declined. This attitude generated a division in the Little Entente. Romanian refusal was also due to the fact that the treaty would have given the USSR the right to cross its territory in order to help Czechoslovakia. For the same reason, Romania refused the conclusion of the mutual assistance pact with France. The pact would have granted France or its ally the Soviet Union permission to use Romanian air bases."

The election would point out the dangerous rise in popularity of the far-right movement and the political party called Everything for the Country" - the official name of the Iron Guard after 1935.\nThe Guard - an ultra-nationalist, anti-communist, antisemitic and fascist in-character movement, would thus secure a front line presence in Romanian politics until January 24, 1941, when it was dismantled after a failed coup against dictator Ion Antonescu."

This body was a paramilitary, mandatory, politically instrumented propaganda organization.  It also served to counterbalance the growing influence of the Legionnaire Movement among Romanian youth.\n\nNot accidentally, "Straja Tarii" adopted a style that included many similarities with the Iron Guard, such as organization, discipline, and symbols.

To meet the demands, on July 4, a new government was formed, led by Ion Gigurtu, which immediately pursued "a sincere political integration in the system created by the Berlin-Rome Axis."
