 ROM_flexible_foreign_policy_desc:0 "With a revanchist Hungary and Hitler in the west seeking more and more rights and territories by undoing the Versailles treaties,\nand with the Soviet Union in the east seeking to re-take the territories of the old Russian Empire, there is only one conclusion to be made:\nWe are facing the greatest peril we have faced since The Great War.\nTherefore, we must seek allies with whoever can vow to protect our territories, or else we will surely lose them."
