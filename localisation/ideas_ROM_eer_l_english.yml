 ROM_eer_majadahonda_desc:0 "In 1936, as a reaction to Titulescu morally supporting the communist side in the Spanish Civil War, the Iron Guard (Garda de Fier) sent seven of its men to fight on the nationalist side. However, Ion Moţa and Vasile Marin, two of those seven men, have been killed by an artillery shell in the Spanish town of Majadahonda (near Madrid).\n\nThe Iron Guard will repatriate them back to Romania and tour their coffins around the country for 30 days before burying them in an elaborate well-attended ceremony, which will serve them very well in terms of propaganda."
